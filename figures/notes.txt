- first computers -- antikythera mechanism, babbage's difference engine (proposed), eniac (first electronic), taihu light (fastest today, 10^17 operations per second)
- moore's law reaching a limit due to atomic size. at atomic size the world becomes quantum mechanical
- may as well embrace it. opens up a whole new type of computing power
- superposition explained through light based random number generator
- classical and quantum bits explained in the normal way
- followed by schrodinger's cat (i really want an alternative to this)
- entanglement with two qubits (real reference with photons to space)
- 1 qubit = perfect random numbers. 2 qubits = secure encryption. many qubits = super powerful 2^N
- 38:00 discussion of simulating quantum bits with a classical machine
- 41:00 shor's algorithm
- 43:00 shor's algorithm factoring time
- 45:00 applications of quantum simulators
- 46:30 using quantum mechanics to simulate physics with feynmann "simulating physics with computers"
- 49:00 nitrogen fixation application

simulations
-- nitrogen fixation (involves simulations of simple molecules like ammonia -- used in fertilizer production -- consumes a huge amount of the worlds energy
